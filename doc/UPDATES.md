# next
 * Logs now include timestamps for forwarded messages.

# master
  * Require C++11 compiler support (GCC 48+, Clang 3.4+)
  * Wraith now automatically assigns roles to bots for channels, no longer
    requiring manually assigning them with flags +flry for flood, limit,
    resolve, auto-voice, auto-op. These roles are decentralized and per-chan
    such that net-splits and botnet-splits and multiple groups in 1 chan
    will properly assign roles out to bots to not cause overlap. Only leaf
    bots know which bots have which roles. (#39)
  * Add cmd_roles (leaf only) to display roles for a channel. (#39)
  * Add 'chanset homechan-user [nothing/voice/op]' to auto-voice or auto-op
    clients who are opped in 'set homechan'.
  * Some small performance improvements.
  * CPRIVMSG/CNOTICE/TIME/TOPIC/OPER should end connection bursting on ratbox.
  * Fix server connect bursting for joining channels with help from other bots.
  * Tweak server connect burst to progress quicker.
  * Sort cmd_groups and cmd_bots better.
  * cmd_groups: Indicate which bots are down with a _*_.
