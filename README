Wraith is an IRC bot written purely in C/C++. It has been in development since late 2003.
It is based on Eggdrop 1.6.12 but has since evolved into something much different at its
core. TCL and loadable modules are currently not supported.

Wraith aims to be a secure and easy to setup and manage botnet.
A botnet can be setup in a matter of minutes and updated later with 1 command.
Leaf bots save no files locally, but rather store configuration encrypted in their own binary.
Hubs do not connect to IRC, and keep a local encrypted copy of the userfile.

All official sites, documentation, support venues, repositories and source urls are referenced here.
